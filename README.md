# Nessus-Vulnerability-Management-Home-Lab

## Description

**Installed and configured Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed vulnerability scan against Windows 10 Hosts and remediated discovered vulnerabilities**

Downloaded VMware Workstation Player and installed it to the host system that would be managing be managing the several virtual machines(VMs). A Windows 10 ISO was downloaded along with Nessus Essentials being downloaded and installed on the same host system. Utilizing VMware, I created several VMs and configured them with the Windows 10 ISO file previously downloaded. After the VMs were set up with their respective Windows 10 operating systems installed, I ensured that their was connectivity between the host system and the VMs hosted within it. Testing the connection by sending command prompt pings to the virtual machine. 

In order to conduct credentialed scans on the virtual machines, credentials were provided to Nessus. The Remote Registry was enabled on the virtual machines, allowing Nessus to connect to the VM's registry to inspect and identify vulnerabilites. File and printer sharing was also enabled.  

## Tools
