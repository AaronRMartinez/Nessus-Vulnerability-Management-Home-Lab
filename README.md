# Nessus-Vulnerability-Management-Home-Lab

## Description

**Installed and configured Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed vulnerability scan against Windows 10 Hosts and remediated discovered vulnerabilities**

Downloaded VMware Workstation Player and installed it to the host system that would be managing be managing the several virtual machines(VMs). A Windows 10 ISO was downloaded along with Nessus Essentials being downloaded and installed on the same host system. Utilizing VMware, I created several VMs and configured them with the Windows 10 ISO file previously downloaded. After the VMs were set up with their respective Windows 10 operating systems installed, I ensured that their was connectivity between the host system and the VMs hosted within it. Testing the connection by sending command prompt pings to the virtual machine. 

In order to conduct credentialed scans on the virtual machines, credentials were provided to Nessus. The Remote Registry was enabled on the virtual machines, allowing Nessus to connect to the VM's registry to inspect and identify vulnerabilites. File and printer sharing was also enabled. In order to connect to the registry with Nessus, a key was added to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE throught the registry editor. Restarting the virtual machine after the completion of the key being added. 

Once everything was finally configured, a credentialed scan was done on a virtual machine to inspect and identify any present vulnerabilities. The results of the credentialed scan was inspected, with Nessus providing a list of remediations being offered. A deprecated version of Firefox was also installed in order to observe the results of a credentialed scan on the VM. Results between the initial scan and the scan that included the deprecated Firefox
