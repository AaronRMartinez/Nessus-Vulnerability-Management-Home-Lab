# Nessus-Vulnerability-Management-Home-Lab

## Description

**Installed and configured Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed vulnerability scan against Windows 10 Hosts and remediated discovered vulnerabilities**

Downloaded VMware Workstation Player and installed it to the host system that would be managing the several virtual machines(VMs). Both Windows 10 ISO and Nessus Essentials were downloaded while the latter was installed on the host system. Utilizing VMware, I created several VMs and configured them with the Windows 10 ISO file previously downloaded. After the VMs were set up with their respective operating systems installed, I ensured that their was connectivity between the VMs and the host system. Trialing and testing the connection between them by sending command prompt pings to the virtual machines. 

In order to conduct credentialed scans on the virtual machines, credentials were provided to Nessus Essentials. The Remote Registry was enabled on the virtual machines, allowing Nessus to connect to the VM's registry to inspect and identify vulnerabilites. Furthermore, file and printer sharing were also enabled. To connect to the registry with Nessus, a key was added to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE directory by the registry editor. Once added, the virtual machine was restarted to ensure the changes were present. 

As everything was finally configured, a credentialed scan was ran on a virtual machine to examine and identify any existing vulnerabilities. The results of the credentialed scan was examined along with a list of remediations Nessus suggested. As a trial, a deprecated version of Firefox was also installed in order to observe the results of a credentialed scan on the VM. The results between the initial scan without the deprecated Firefox software and the scan with the software were compared to display the inherent risks carried by the installed, outdated software. The suggested remediations recommended by Nessus were investigated and conducted on the VM. With one final credentialed scan being done to note and verify that the remediations done on the virtual machine hardened the VM.

## Tools

**Nessus:** Vulnerability scanner used to identify and address potential security risks in systems or small networks

**VMware Workstation Player:** virtualization software that allows users to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single physical machine by creating and managing virtual machines (VMs).
