# Nessus-Vulnerability-Management-Home-Lab

## Description

**Installed and configured Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed vulnerability scan against Windows 10 Hosts and remediated discovered vulnerabilities**

Downloaded VMware Workstation Player and installed it to the host system that would be managing be managing the several virtual machines(VMs). A Windows 10 ISO was downloaded along with Nessus Essentials being downloaded and installed on the same host system. Utilizing VMware, I created several VMs and configured them with the Windows 10 ISO file previously downloaded. After the VMs were set up with their respective Windows 10 operating systems installed, I ensured that their was connectivity between the host system and the VMs hosted within it.
